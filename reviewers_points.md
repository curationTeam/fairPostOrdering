### Reviewer 2

#### Knowledgeable, weak reject

1. Unclear take-home message (done)
1. Simplistic voting protocol (unfixable)
1. Steemit isn't even supposed to be Sybil resilient (false)
1. Compare with other voting protocols:

   * Kakhki et al, "Iolaus: Securing Online Content Rating Systems"
   * Tran et al, "Sybil-Resilient Online Content Voting"

   * Viswanath et al, "Canal: Scaling Social Network-Based Sybil Tolerance Schemes"
   * Meo et al, "Using Centrality Measures to Predict Helpfulness-Based Reputation in Trust Networks"
1. Get inspiration from other studies:
   * Zhu, "Measurement and analysis of an online content voting network: a case study of Digg"
   * Shen et al, "Knowledge Sharing in the Online Social Network of Yahoo! Answers and Its Implications"
   * Liu, "Systematic Measurement of Centralized Online Reputation Systems"
