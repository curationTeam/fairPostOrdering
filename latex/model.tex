  \subsection{Properties of Post Voting Systems}
    A post voting system has the objective to arrange the posts according to the
    preferences of the participants. The ideal order is defined based on the
    likeability matrix for the posts.

    The ideal score of a post is a single number that represents its overall
    worth to the community. By using simple summation, we assume that the
    opinions of all players have the same weight. In an ordered list of posts
    where higher posts are more visible, the ``common interest'' would require
    that a post with higher ideal score appear before another post with a lower
    score.

    The above result is tight.
    If the conditions are violated the above theorem is not true.
