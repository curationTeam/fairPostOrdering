  \subsection{Post list}
    \subimport{./modelfiles/definitions/}{postdef.tex}

    \noindent $\playerlen$ represents the number of voters (a.k.a. players). A
    post has a distinct likability in $\left[0, 1\right]$ for each player.

    \subimport{./modelfiles/definitions/}{idealpostscoredef.tex}

    \noindent The ideal score of a post is a single number that represents its
    overall worth to the community. By using simple summation, we assume that
    the opinions of all players have the same weight.

    \subimport{./modelfiles/definitions/}{postlistdef.tex}

    \noindent In the case of many UGC platforms, e.g. Steemit, there exists a
    feed (commonly named ``Trending'') that displays the same ordered posts for
    all users. In such an ordered list, posts placed closer to the top are more
    visible, since users typically consume content from top to bottom. We can
    thus measure the quality of an ordered list of posts by comparing it with a
    list that contains the same posts in decreasing order of ideal score.

  \subsection{Post Voting System}

    We now define an abstract post-voting system. Such a system is defined
    through two Interactive Turing Machines (ITMs),
    $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{Feed}}$ and $\Pi_{\mathrm{honest}}$. The first
    controls the list of posts and aggregates votes, whereas one copy of the
    second ITM is instantiated for each player. $\mathcal{G}_{\mathrm{Feed}}$
    sends the post list to one player at a time, receives her vote and reorders
    the post list accordingly. The process is possibly repeated for many rounds.

    A measure of the quality of a post-voting system is the $t$-ideal rank of
    the post list at the end of the process.

    In a more general setting, some of the honest protocol instantiations may be
    replaced with an arbitrary ITM. A robust post-voting system should still
    produce a post list of high quality.

    \subimport{./modelfiles/definitions/}{pvsdef.tex}

    \noindent Players are activated by an Environment ITM that sends activation
    messages (Algorithm~\ref{alg:honest}, line~\ref{alg:honest:activate}).

    \subimport{./modelfiles/definitions/}{actmsg.tex}
    \subimport{./modelfiles/definitions/}{execpat.tex}
    \subimport{./modelfiles/definitions/}{tconvergencedef.tex}

    \noindent Note that concrete post voting systems may or may not give
    information such as the total number of rounds $\rounds$ to the players.
    This is decided in algorithm \textsc{Aux}.

    We now give a high-level description of a concrete post voting system, based
    on the Steemit platform. According to this mechanism, each player is
    assigned a number of coins known as ``Steem Power'' ($\stpow$) that remains
    constant throughout the execution and another number called ``Voting Power''
    ($\votpow$) in $\left[0, 1\right]$, initialized to 1. $a$ and $b$ are
    system-wide constants that roughly specify how influential a single vote is.
    A vote is a pair containing a post and a weight $w \in \left[0, 1\right]$.
    Upon receiving a list of posts, the honest player chooses to vote her most
    liked post amongst the top $\attspan$ posts of the list. The weight $w$ is
    chosen to be equal to the likability of the post. The functionality
    increases the score of the post by $\stpow\left(a \cdot \votpow \cdot w +
    b\right)$ and subsequently decreases the player's Voting Power by the same
    amount (but keeping it within the aforementioned bounds). Voting Power is
    replenished with time, at a rate defined by the parameter $\regen$. The
    purpose of Voting Power is to ``rate limit'' votes.
