\section{Related Work}
  User-generated content (UGC) has been identified as a fundamental component of
  social media platforms and Web 2.0 in general~\cite{kaplan2010users}. The
  content created by users needs to be curated, and crowdsourced content
  curation~\cite{askalidis2013theoretical} has emerged as an alternative to
  expert-based~\cite{stanoevska2012content} or
  algorithmic-based~\cite{rader2015understanding} curation techniques. Motivated
  by the widespread adoption of crowdsourced aggregation sites such as Reddit or
  Digg\footnote{\url{http://digg.com/} Accessed: 2019-01-02}, several research
  efforts~\cite{das2010ranking,ghosh2011incentivizing,abbassi2014distributed}
  have aimed to model the mechanics and incentives for users in UGC platforms.
  This surge of interest is accompanied by studies which have shown how social
  media users behave strategically when they publish and consume
  content~\cite{may2014filter}. As an example, in the case of Reddit, users try
  to maximize their `karma'~\cite{bergstrom2011don}, the social badge of the
  social media platform~\cite{anderson2013steering}.

  Previous works have analyzed content curation from an incentives and
  game-theoretic
  standpoint~\cite{ghosh2011incentivizing,das2010ranking,gupte2009news,may2014filter,abbassi2014distributed}
  . Our formalisation is based on these models and inherits features such as the
  quality distribution of the articles and the users' attention
  span~\cite{askalidis2013theoretical,ghosh2011incentivizing}. In terms of the
  analysis of our results, the analysis of our \textit{$t$-convergence} metric
  is similar to the top-$k$ posts in~\cite{askalidis2013theoretical}. We also
  leverage the rank correlation coefficients Kendall's
  Tau~\cite{kendall1955rank} and Spearman's Rho~\cite{spearman1904proof} to
  measure content curation efficiency. Our approach describes the mechanics of
  post-voting systems from a computational perspective, something that departs
  from the approach of all previous works, drawing inspiration from the
  real-ideal world paradigm of
  cryptography~\cite{goldreich1999foundations,lindell} as employed in our
  definition of $t$-convergence.

  Post-voting systems constitute a special case of voting mechanisms, as studied
  within social choice theory, belonging to the subcategory of cardinal voting
  systems~\cite{hillinger2005case}. In this context, it follows from Gibbard's
  theorem~\cite{gibbard1973manipulation} that no decentralised non-trivial
  post-voting mechanism can be strategy-proof. This is consistent with our
  results that demonstrate how selfish behaviour is beneficial to the
  participants. Our system shares the property of spanning multiple voting
  rounds with previous work~\cite{kalech2011practical}. Other related literature
  in social
  choice~\cite{lu2011robust,conitzer2005communication,xia2010compilation} is
  centered on political elections and as a result attempts to resolve a
  variation of the problem with quite different constraints and assumptions. In
  more detail, in the case of political elections, voter communication in many
  rounds is costly while navigating the ballot is not subject to any constraints
  as voters are assumed to have plenty of time to parse all the options
  available to them. As a result, voters can express their preferences for any
  candidate, irrespective of the order in which the latter appear on the ballot
  paper. On the other hand, the online and interactive nature of post-voting
  systems make multi-round voting a natural feature to be taken advantage of. At
  the same time, the fairness requirements are more lax and it is acceptable
  (even desirable) for participants to act reactively on the outcome of each
  others' evaluations. On the other hand, in the post-voting case, the
  ``ballot'' is only partially available given the high number of posts to be
  ranked that may very well exceed the time available to a (human) user to
  participate in the process. As a result a user will be unable to vote for
  posts that she has not viewed, for instance, because they are placed at the
  bottom of the list. This is captured in our model by introducing the concept
  of ``attention span.''

  Content curation is also related to the concept of online governance. The
  governance of online communities such as Wikipedia has been thoroughly studied
  in previous academic work~\cite{leskovec2010governance,forte2008scaling}.
  However, the financially incentivized governance processes in blockchain
  systems, where the voters are at the same time equity-holders, have still many
  open research questions~\cite{vitalik,ehrsam}. This shared ownership property
  has triggered interest in building social media platforms backed by
  distributed ledgers, where users are rewarded for generated content and
  variants of coin-holder voting are used to decide how these rewards are
  distributed.

  As already mentioned, coin-weighted voting is a viable mechanism to measure
  the influence of users in the platform and, by extension, to make the system
  more resistant to Sybil attacks. Different countermeasures for the Sybil
  problem in content curation and recommendation sites have been explored in the
  past~\cite{molavi2013iolaus,tran2009sybil,yu2009dsybil,meo2017using}.
  Orthogonal to the coin-weighted voting model, these solutions leverage the
  trust graph of the underlying social network (which is explicitly created by
  users) to bound the effect of Sybil
  votes~\cite{molavi2013iolaus,tran2009sybil,yu2009dsybil}.
  \cite{viswanath2012canal} claim that trust graph-based solutions require heavy
  computation, and propose optimizations for real-world applications modeling
  the transitive trust relationships as credit networks. We acknowledge these
  mechanisms as complementary to coin-weighted voting and potentially
  implementable in Steemit. We note that the abstract post-voting system defined
  in this work can be particularized to include such trust graph-based
  solutions.

  The effects of explicit financial incentives on the quality of content in
  Steemit has been analyzed in~\cite{thelwall2017can}. Beyond the Steemit's
  whitepaper~\cite{steemit}, a series of blog
  posts~\cite{curationRewards,selfvoters} effectively extend the economic
  analysis of the system. In parallel with Steemit, other projects such as
  Synereo~\cite{synereo} and Akasha\footnote{\url{https://akasha.world/}
  Accessed: 2019-01-02} are exploring the convergence of social media and
  decentralized content curation. Beyond blockchain-based social media
  platforms, coin-holder voting systems are present in decentralized platforms
  such as DAOs~\cite{darkdaos} and in different blockchain
  protocols~\cite{dash,tezos}. However, most of these systems use coin-holder
  voting processes to agree on a value or take a consensual decision.
