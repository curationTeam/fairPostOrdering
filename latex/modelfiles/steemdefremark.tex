\begin{remark}
  The constraint $a + b < 1$ ensures that a single vote of full weight cast by a
  player with full Voting Power does not completely deplete her Voting Power.
  The constraint $\ceil*{\frac{a + b}{\regen}} > 1$ excludes the degenerate
  case in which the regeneration of a single round is enough to fully replenish
  the Voting Power in all cases; in this case the purpose of Voting Power would
  be defeated.
\end{remark}

\begin{remark}
  \label{remark:steemitparms}
  The Steem blockchain protocol defines $a = 0.02, b = 0.0001$ and $\regen =
  \frac{3}{5 \cdot 24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60} = 0.0000069\bar{4}$, thus
  $\ceil*{\frac{a + b}{\regen}} = 2895$. A post can be voted for 7 days from its
  creation and at most one vote can be cast every 3 seconds, thus $\rounds =
  \frac{7 \cdot 24 \cdot 60 \cdot 60}{3} = 201600$. We do not know why these
  particular parameters were chosen, but we conjecture that $a, b$ and $\regen$
  ensure users can vote often enough without abusing the system, 7 days is the
  time needed for the quality of a post to be determined and 3 seconds is the
  time needed for transactions to settle in the Steem blockchain.

\begin{remark}
  Note (Algorithm~\ref{alg:steem:vote},
  lines~\ref{alg:steem:vote:votethisround}-\ref{alg:steem:vote:voterounds:end})
  that an honest player attempts to vote for as many posts as possible and
  spreads her votes with the maximum distance between them. The purpose of this
  is to efficiently utilize the available Voting Power to ``make her voice
  heard''. Also, efficiently using Voting Power on the Steemit website increases
  the voter's curation reward~\cite{curationRewards}.
