\begin{definition}[$\left(\playerlen, \rounds, \postlen, t\right)$-convergence
under honesty]
  We say that a post-voting system $\pvs = \left(\textsc{Init}, \textsc{Aux},
  \textsc{HandleVote}, \textsc{Vote}\right)$ $\left(\playerlen, \rounds,
  \postlen, t\right)$-\emph{converges under honesty} (or \emph{$t$-converges
  under honesty for $\playerlen$ players, $\rounds$ rounds and $\postlen$
  posts}) if, for every input $\postlist$ such that $|\postlist| = \postlen$,
  for every $\env$ that respects $\execpat_{\playerlen, \rounds}$ and given that
  all protocols execute $\honeststr$, it holds that after $\env$ completes its
  execution pattern, $\gfunc$ contains a post list $\postlist$ such that
  $\textsc{Ideal}^t\left(\postlist\right)$ is true.
\end{definition}
