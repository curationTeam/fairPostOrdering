\begin{definition}[Post-Voting System]
  A tuple $\pvs = \left(\gfunc, \honeststr\right)$ of two ITMs, parametrized
  by \textsc{Init}, \textsc{Aux}, \textsc{HandleVote} and \textsc{Vote}. The
  two ITMs have to implement the following API:

  $\gfunc$ is a global functionality that accepts two messages:
  \texttt{read}, which responds with the current list of posts and
  \texttt{vote}, which can take various arguments and can do whatever the
  functionality wants. Eventually, the functionality sends a message
  (\texttt{output}, $\postlist$) to $\env$ and halts.\footnote{Alternatively
  $\env$ decides when to stop, but seems dirtier}

  $\honeststr$ is a protocol that sends \texttt{read} and \texttt{vote}
  messages to $\gfunc$ whenever activated by $\env$.
