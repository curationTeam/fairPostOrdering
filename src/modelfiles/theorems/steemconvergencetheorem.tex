\begin{theorem}
  The Steem system $\left(\playerlen, \rounds, \postlen, t\right)$-converges if
  and only if $\stpowvec$ is constant and $\rounds - 1 \geq \left(\postlen -
  1\right) \ceil*{\frac{a + b}{\regen}}$.
\end{theorem}

  \paragraph{Discussion}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\stpowvec$ has to be constant, i.e. all players should have the
      same money. Otherwise let $\postlist = \left(\left(1, \left(a_1, \dots,
      a_\playerlen\right)\right), \left(2, \left(b_1, \dots,
      b_\playerlen\right)\right)\right)$ such that the following linear
      constraints are simultaneously feasible:
      \begin{gather*}
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen a_i > \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen b_i \\
        \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen \stpow_i a_i < \sum\limits_{i=1}^\playerlen
        \stpow_i  b_i \\
      \end{gather*}
      I think that's always possible if $\stpow$ is not constant.
      \item If players have attention span smaller than the full list and do not
      have the rounds to vote for every post, make a $\postlist$ with the best
      post at the end and it will stay there.
      \item If players must vote without full voting power but have the time to
      vote for all posts, we again place the good posts at the end. Players will
      vote for them with little voting power and they will not rise to the top.
      \item For $|\postlist|$-convergence, we need every player to vote for all
      posts with full voting power, i.e. $\rounds - 1 \geq \left(|\postlist| -
      1\right) \ceil*{\frac{a + b}{\regen}}$. But we can simply send a huge
      $\postlist$.
    \end{itemize}
