  \subsection{Properties of Post Voting Systems}
    A post voting system has the objective to arrange the posts according to the
    preferences of the participants. The ideal order is defined based on the
    likeability matrix for the posts.

    The score of a post is a single number that represents its overall worth to
    the community. By using simple summation, we assume that the opinions of all
    players have the same weight. In an ordered list of posts where higher posts
    are more visible, the ``common interest'' would require that a post with
    higher score appear before another post with a lower score.

    The above result is tight.
    If the conditions are violated the above theorem is not true.
