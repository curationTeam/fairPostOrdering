p.  2: some context first
       (cont cur) Term used for other purposes, but here...
p.  3: several types of cont cur
       *Human* moderator processes posts
p.  4: Users' feedback input to ranking algorithm
       complicated, but good solutions exist (reddit)
p.  5: Ranking algorithm run in a decentralized manner
p.  6: Steemit: biggest Dec cont cur platform
       Steem -> blockchain (app-chain, hosts more projects - e.g. DTube)
       Steemit -> platform (website)
       separate projects
       post creation & voting registered on-chain
p.  7: our focus: post ranking
       voting gives money to creator
       explain creation -> voting -> closing flow
p.  8: both simulations
p.  9: likability in [0, 1], explain
       we ignore post content
       total likability = sum of likabilities
       we answer: how ideal are steem-curated lists?
p. 10: setup inspired by simulation-based security
       Env orchestrates - activates players for some rounds
       G_feed holds post list - represents uncorruptible aggregator
       G_feed initialized with post list (in some order)
       limitation: execution lasts R rounds
p. 11: abstract because parametrized by functions
p. 13: we say G_feed ...-converges
       only honest players, but possibly adversarial post list
       first t posts ordered as in ideal list
p. 14: G_feed runs init, aux, handleVote
       aux gives others' money (irl parties can see on chain)
       explain Voting Power
       Pi_honest runs vote
       Steemit has constant values for parameters
       ^1 week to vote
       1 vote/user/post
       vote weighted by:
         a) user-defined weight
         b) user's money
         c) user's Voting Power (explain)
p. 15: Actual theorem parametric
       many details missing
p. 16: likabilities uniformly distributed
       all players same money
       3 ranking metrics wrt round number
       parameters exactly like Steemit
       70 posts, 100 players
       slow, then rapid improvement in all 3
p. 17: low values in all 3
       100 posts, 100 players
p. 18: t-ideal rank and positions gained wrt #selfish players
       selfish have 1 post, all vote only for it
       selfish very handicapped:
         a) post at bottom
         b) post not liked by anyone else
       0 selfish -> perfect ranking
       tragic: 1 selfish -> almost 0 ranking
       good news: no gains until voting ring size >= (#honest players) / 2
p. 20: e.g. many posts/many votes
       with specific utility functions
       post additions throughout execution
