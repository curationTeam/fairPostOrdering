p.  2: some context first
       (cont cur) Term used for other purposes, but here...
p.  3: several types of cont cur
       *Human* moderator processes posts
p.  4: Users' feedback input to ranking algorithm
       complicated, but good solutions exist (reddit)
p.  5: Ranking algorithm run in a decentralized manner
p.  6: Steemit: biggest Dec cont cur platform
       Steem -> blockchain (app-chain, hosts more projects - e.g. DTube)
       Steemit -> platform (website)
       separate projects
       post creation & voting registered on-chain
p.  7: our focus: post ranking
       voting gives money to creator
p.  8: both simulations
p.  9: likability in [0, 1], explain
       we ignore post content
       total likability = sum of likabilities
       we answer: how ideal are steem-curated lists?
p. 10: setup inspired by simulation-based security
       Env orchestrates - activates players for some rounds
       G_feed holds post list - represents uncorruptible aggregator
       G_feed initialized with post list (in some order)
p. 11: abstract because parametrized by functions
p. 13: we say G_feed ...-converges
       only honest players, but possibly adversarial post list
p. 21: e.g. many posts/many votes
       with specific utility functions
       post additions throughout execution
